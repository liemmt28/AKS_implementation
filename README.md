# AKS_implementation

This is my implementations for AKS algorithm for primality test, written in SageMath.

This is an unconditional deterministic polynomial-time algorithm for primality test.

This was also my essay in Computer Algebra class at my University. A more detailed one can be found here (written in Vietnamese): <https://www.overleaf.com/read/bvxgtcpzcpzc>
